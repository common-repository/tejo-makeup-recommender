== Description ==

The Tejo Makeup Recommender is a service that allows your customers use their camera to take a record a video of themselves to get personal 
makeup and skincare recommendations tailored to their own skin type. This wordpress plugin uses an iframe embedded in a widget which you
can place anywhere in your store for your customers to access. The iframe displays the content of a URL from tejo.ca which contains the
camera applet. Once your customers take a picture of themselves, a page containing product recommendations will appear to them. Please
contact Tejo at customerservice@tejo.ca or use the Calendly link above to book a meeting in order to get your business onboarded with Tejo,
and your products added to Tejo's database.
